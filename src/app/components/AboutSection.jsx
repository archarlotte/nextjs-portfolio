            I am a full-stack web developer with over three years of experience in building scalable
            and high-performance web applications. I have experience working with JavaScript, TypeScript, React,
            Redux, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and Git, with a strong ability to work across both
            frontend and backend systems. I have a passion for creating seamless user experiences and writing clean,
            maintainable code. Iâ€™m experienced in integrating complex backend services with dynamic frontend components
            and have worked in Agile environments, actively contributing to sprint planning, collaboration, and timely
             project delivery. Always eager to learn, I continuously seek opportunities to refine my skills and contribute to innovative, impactful projects.
